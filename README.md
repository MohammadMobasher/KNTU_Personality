> Full Description
 Knowledge about an individualsâ€™ personality can allow us to make predictions about preferences across contexts and environments, and enhance recommendation systems. This is not only for recommendation but also useful for commercial purposes and also help in understanding the mental health and high risk factors of online users. There are not many golden standard datasets from social media platforms available for the personality prediction task. The main reason is that gathering labeled data is time-consuming and expensive. That is why we decided to create a suitable data set. We present PD_KNTU, a novel dataset developed to aid research in personality detections. The PD_KNTU dataset is list of people (1500) who got personality test from www.16personalities.com and shared the results in twitter social network. Each user represented with 17 features:
- id
- screen_name
- name
- url
- followers_count
- friends_count
- status_count
- favorites_count

- listed_count
- description
- contributors
- enable
- protected
- location
- lang
- MBTI
- gender

 For each user we download maximum 3000 recent tweets (for someone there is no tweet). The final dataset contains 3182352 Tweets.
 In this corpora we collected 50 people and for each people 1000 recent tweets.
